# Why it is so difficult to apply DI on apache spark

As we know, [dependency injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) (DI) is a famous design pattern that is widely used in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It separates the responsibility of "use" from the responsibility of "construction", and keeps modules evolving independently.

There are some mature dependency injection frameworks in JVM world, such as [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice) and [Spring framework](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/core.html), which are all designed to work properly in a single JVM process.

A spark job is a distributed application which requires collaboration of multiple JVMs. Under such circumstances, it is so common to pass some object from the driver to executors, and spark requires the passed object and all its direct or in-direct dependencies to be serializable (as described by the following picture), which needs quite a lot of efforts. Not to mention if the checkpoint is enabled in spark streaming, more objects need to be serialized. Normal DI framework can't handle it for us.

# What can the neutrino framework do
The neutrino framework is designed to relieve the serialization work in spark application. In fact, in most cases except for the data object (such as elements in RDD), our framework will handle the serialization/deserialization work automatically (include normal object serialization and checkpoint).

And the framework also provides some handy DI object scope management features, such as Singleton Scope per JVM, StreamingBatch scope (reuse the object in the same spark streaming batch per JVM).
In addition, the spark key utility object such as SparkContext, SparkSession, StreamingContext are also injectable, which provides more flexibility for the orchestration of the spark job.

# How does the neutrino handle the serialization problem

As we know, to adopt the DI framework, we need to first build a dependency graph first, which describes the dependency relationship between multiple instances. Guice uses Module API to build the graph while the Spring framework uses XML file or annotations.
The neutrino is built based on [Guice framework](https://github.com/google/guice), and of course builds the dependency graph with the guice module API. It doesn't only keep the graph in the driver, but also have the same graph running on every executor.

![serialize creation method](./images/serialize_creation_method.png)

If an object is about to be passed to another JVM, instead of serializing the object and its dependencies, the neutrino framework remembers the creation method of the object, passes the information to the target JVM, and recreates it and all its dependencies with the graph there in the same way, The object even doesn't have to be serializable, all of which is done automatically by the framework.
Here is an example:

## Example: handle serialization automatically
Consider such a case that there is an event stream, and we'd like to abstract the logic to filter the stream based on a white list of user ids, which is stored in the database. Here is how we implement it with the neutrino.

```scala
import javax.inject.Inject
import scala.collection.mutable

case class TestEvent(userId: String)

trait EventFilter[T] {
    def filter(t: T): Boolean
}

// here is the spark job logic
val injectorBuilder = sparkSession.newInjectorBuilder()
val injector = injectorBuilder.newRootInjector(new FilterModule(dbConfig))
injectorBuilder.prepareInjectors() // Don't forget to call this before getting any instance from injector

val filter = injector.instance[EventFilter[TestEvent]]
val eventStream: DStream[TestEvent] = ...
eventStream.filter(e => filter.filter(e))

// OR
DStream[TestEvent]
    .filter(e => injector.instance[EventFilter[TestEvent]].filter(e))
```
Generally, the `EventFilter[TestEvent]` instance must implement the `java.io.Serializable` interface since it is passed from the driver to executors. But with the neutrino framework, we don't need to do that.
```scala
class DbUserWhiteListsEventFilter @Inject()(dbConnection: java.sql.Connection) extends EventFilter[TestEvent] {
    private lazy val userIdSet = {
        getAllUserIds(dbConnection)
    }

    override def filter(t: TestEvent): Boolean = {
        t.userId != null && userIdSet.contains(t.userId)
    }
}

// how to generate the db connection
case class DbConfig(url: String, userName: String, password: String)
class DbConnectionProvider @Inject()(dbConfig: DbConfig) extends Provider[java.sql.Connection] {
    override def get(): Connection = {
        DriverManager.getConnection(
            dbConfig.url,
            dbConfig.userName,
            dbConfig.password);
    }
}
```
Here is how we bind the dependencies with the module API extensions introduced in the neutrino framework.
```scala
class FilterModule(dbConfig: DbConfig) extends SparkModule {
    override def configure(): Unit = {
        bind[DbConfig].toInstance(dbConfig)
        bind[java.sql.Connection].toProvider[DbConnectionProvider].in[SingletonScope]
        // the magic here
        bind[EventFilter[TestEvent]].withSerializableWrapper.to[DbUserWhiteListsEventFilter].in[SingletonScope]
    }
}
```
The extension method `withSerializableWrapper` will generate a serializable wrapper with the same interface (`EventFilter[TestEvent]`) to replace the actual binding. This wrapper object is small, serializable and contains the creation info of the target object. When it is used in the driver, it is just a proxy to the actual object, but while passed to the executors, it will creates the same object with the dependency graph there after deserialization.

And since the scope for the object `EventFilter[TestEvent]` is `SingletonScope` (singleton per JVM, including both the driver and executor JVMs), the same object would be reused if there is already one there. While with normal serialization way (no neutrino support), new object will be created every time it is passed to the executors.

Since `DbUserWhiteListsEventFilter` is created with the graph per JVM, so all its dependencies even the `java.sql.Connection` can be injected, which will also be created per JVM according to the binding defined in the module.

**There is only one limitation** --- all the modules creating the dependency graph have to be serializable (the base class `SparkModule` has already implemented the `java.io.Serializable`), which is rather easy to handle. For the above example, the only thing need to be serialized is `DbConfig`.

## Example: recover the job from spark checkpoint
Sometimes we need to enable the checkpoint in case of job failure, which requires any closure object used in the processing logic to be serializable. The neutrino framework would automatically handle the recovering work for all objects generated from the graph (even the injectors themselves). Internally, when the job is recovering, it rebuilds the graph on every JVM firstly, based on which all objects are regenerated.
Here is an example of how to do that:
```scala
import com.hulu.neutrino._

val injectorBuilder = sparkSession.newInjectorBuilder()
val injector = injectorBuilder.newRootInjector(new FilterModule(dbConfig))
injectorBuilder.prepareInjectors() // Don't forget to call this before getting any instance from injector

val checkpointPath = "hdfs://HOST/checkpointpath"

// Don't call StreamingContext.getOrCreate directly
val streamingContext = sparkSession.getOrCreateStreamingContext(checkpointPath, session => {
    // Don't call the constructor directly
    val streamContext = session.newStreamingContext(Duration(1000*30))
    streamContext.checkpoint(checkpointPath)
    val eventStream: DStream[TestEvent] = ...
    eventStream
        .filter(e => rootInjector.instance[EventFilter[TestEvent]].filter(e))
    streamContext
})

streamingContext.start()
streamingContext.awaitTermination()
```

## Advanced usage for automatic serialization handling
The auto-generated serializable wrapper assumes the binding type is an interface (or trait for scala). If it is not the case, like some concrete or final class, the neutrino framework provides a way to get a serializable `Provider[T]` instance which contains the creation method of the target object, and this provider object can be used to passed around JVMs.

(Note: in native Guice API, we can also get a provider for the instance, but the provider is not serializable)

Here is an example:
```scala
final class EventProcessor {
    def process(event: TestEvent)
}

class StreamHandler {
    private var provider: Provider[EventProcessor]
    
    @InjectSerializableProvider
    def setProvider(provider: Provider[EventProcessor]): Unit = {
        this.provider = provider
    }
    
    def handleStream(eventStream: DStream[TestEvent]): Unit = {
        val localProvider = provider
        eventStream.map { e =>
            localProvider.get().process(e)
        }
    }
}
```

Currently, the serializable `Provider[T]` can only be retrieved via annotation `InjectSerializableProvider` on a setter method.

# New scopes
## Example: StreamingBatch scope
 If we evolve the example above a little, say the user white list in the database is changeable, and we'd like to update the white list data in every batch. To achieve this goal, all we need to do is to bind the instance with a different scope.
```scala
class FilterModule(dbConfig: DbConfig) extends SparkModule {
    override def configure(): Unit = {
        // the same as the above example
        bind[DbConfig].toInstance(dbConfig)
        bind[java.sql.Connection].toProvider[DbConnectionProvider].in[SingletonScope]
        // just change the scope from SingletonScope to StreamingBatch
        bind[EventFilter[TestEvent]].withSerializableWrapper.to[DbUserWhiteListsEventFilter].in[StreamingBatch]
    }
}
```
With the `StreamingBatch` scope, the instance for `EventFilter[TestEvent]` will be created per streaming batch, and reused within the batch. So the white list data will be reloaded every batch.

# Other features
## Some key spark objects are also injectable
These injectable objects include SparkSession, SparkContext, StreamingContext, which makes the spark application more flexible.
With it, we can even make `DStream[T]` or `RDD[T]` injectable. [Here](./examples/src/main/scala/com/hulu/neutrino/example/TestEventStreamProvider.scala) is an example. 

## Injector Hierarchy / Child Injector
The Injector Hierarchy/Child Injector is also supported. Here is a simple example.
```scala
val injectorBuilder = sparkSession.newInjectorBuilder()
val rootInjector = injectorBuilder.newRootInjector(new ParentModule())
val childInjector rootInjector.createChildInjector(new ChildModule())
// this prepareInjectors must be called after all injectors are built and before any instance is retrieved from any injector
injectorBuilder.prepareInjectors()
```
Note: All children injectors belonged to the same root injector are in the same dependency graph, and all of them are serializable.

## Multiple dependency graphs in single job
In most cases, we only need a single dependency graph in a spark job, but if there is any necessity to separate the dependencies between different logic, the neutrino also provide a way to create separate graphs. All you need to do is provide a different name for each graph. The name for the default graph is "default".
Here is an example
```scala
import com.hulu.neutrino._

val defaultInjectorBuilder = sparkSession.newInjectorBuilder()
val injector1 = defaultInjectorBuilder.newRootInjector(new FilterModule(dbConfig))
injectorBuilder.prepareInjectors()

val injectorBuilder2 = sparkSession.newInjectorBuilder("another graph")
val injector2 = injectorBuilder2.newRootInjector(new FilterModule(dbConfig))
injectorBuilder.prepareInjectors()

// any spark logic
```
This feature may be useful in spark test cases. Under the test circumstances, a SparkContext object will be reused to run multiple test jobs, then different names have to be specified to distinguish them.
